        This place is run by educated, innovative & creative people! The architectural layout, seating, ambience, lighting, cutlery, service, design has been impeccably well thought out. Even the washrooms were excellent! The food was AWESOME! This is surprising considering the fact we were there on a Saturday night & they almost had no specials. We were extremely well serviced too! Rare to find such finesse in Kenya! You must go visit them!
